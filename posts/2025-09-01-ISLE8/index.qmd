A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of presenting my research at the **ISLE8 (CILC 2025)** held at the University of Santiago de Compostela.

My presentation examined the complementation patterns of five English retrospective verbs — *remember, forget, regret, recall,* and *recollect* — focusing on their alternation between finite clauses and non-finite *-ing* complements. Using data from historical and present-day corpora (CEECS, CLMET 3.1, and GloWbE), the study traced a clear diachronic shift towards *-ing* complementation, which becomes increasingly dominant in later stages of English. The analysis showed that verbs such as *remember* and *regret* are at the forefront of this change, while *recall* and *recollect* follow the same trend to a lesser extent and *forget* remains comparatively stable. Overall, the findings suggest that the expansion of *-ing* complements is linked to broader changes in English complementation patterns and discourse style, particularly a growing preference for more experiential and subjective modes of expression

Many thanks to the organisers and participants for such a stimulating conference and for the insightful questions and feedback. It was a great opportunity to share work and engage with colleagues working on the linguistics of English from diverse theoretical and empirical perspectives.
