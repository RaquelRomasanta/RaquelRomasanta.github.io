On 2 June I was awarded the [Richard M. Hogg Prize](https://www.isle-linguistics.org/activities/richard-m-hogg-prize) of the [International Society for the Linguistics of English (IsLE)](https://www.isle-linguistics.org/) for my paper *Negation as a predictor of clausal complement choice in World Englishes*

The Prize is awarded in open competition to early-career scholars, both pre and postdoctoral scholars. The Prize involves cash prize of £500, the publication of her paper on the **IsLE website**, an invitation and financial support to present her work in the next **IsLE conference**, and, additionally, an invitation to submit her prize-winning paper for competitive review for publication in *English Language and Linguistics*, the journal closely associated with the aims of the Society. The paper was later published in this journal in [open access](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1360674321000241).
