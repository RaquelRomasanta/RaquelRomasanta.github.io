I'm honoured to share that on June 2nd I was awarded the [Richard M. Hogg Prize](https://www.isle-linguistics.org/activities/richard-m-hogg-prize){target="_blank"} by the [International Society for the Linguistics of English (IsLE)](https://www.isle-linguistics.org/){target="_blank"} for my paper *Negation as a Predictor of Clausal Complement Choice in World Englishes*.

This prize is awarded in open competition to early-career scholars — both predoctoral and postdoctoral — and includes a £500 cash award, the publication of the paper on the IsLE website, and an invitation (with financial support) to present the research at the next IsLE conference.

In addition, the paper was invited for submission to *English Language and Linguistics* — the journal closely associated with the Society — where it was later published as an [open access](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1360674321000241){target="_blank"} article.

I’m incredibly grateful to the IsLE community for this recognition and support.
