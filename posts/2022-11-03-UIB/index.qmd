Last September, I joined the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) as a Junior Lecturer (*Ayudante Doctora*) in the Department of Spanish, Modern and Classical Philology.

Established in 1978, the University of the Balearic Islands is a dynamic institution with a strong international outlook and a growing research profile. The Department of Spanish, Modern and Classical Philology offers a diverse academic environment that brings together specialists in language, literature, and linguistics across several linguistic traditions.
