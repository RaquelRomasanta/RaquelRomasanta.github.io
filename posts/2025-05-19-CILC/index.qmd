A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of presenting my latest research at the **16th International Conference on Corpus Linguistics (CILC 2025)**, organised by **AELINCO** and held at the University of Santiago de Compostela.

My paper, titled *Retrospective verbs across time*, examined the diachronic and synchronic behaviour of five retrospective verbs â€” *remember, forget, regret, recall,* and *recollect* â€” across different English varieties. The study draws on extensive historical and present-day corpus data to explore how patterns of verb complementation evolve and diverge, particularly in postcolonial contexts.

Many thanks to the organisers, colleagues, and attendees for the insightful discussions and feedback. It was a fantastic opportunity to share ideas and connect with fellow researchers.
