I obtained the three-year postodoctoral contract [Margarita Salas](https://www.universidades.gob.es/ayudas-a-la-recualificacion/), a competitive grant offered by the Ministry of Universities. I will be working with the [SPERTUS](https://www.spertus.es/index.html) team, led by Ignacio Palacios Mart√≠nez at the University of Santiago de Compostela.
