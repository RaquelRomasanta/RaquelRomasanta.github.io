I obtained my PhD this morning. The dissertation is entitled [*Variation in the clausal complementation system in World Englishes: A corpus-based study of REGRET*](https://www.investigo.biblioteca.uvigo.es/xmlui/handle/11093/1688?show=full){target="_blank"} and merited the highest grade (sobresaliente cum laude). Supervisors: Elena Seoane (University of Vigo) and Manfred Krug (University of Bamberg).

I want to express our gratitude to the board members, Professors Sarah Buschfeld (TU Dortmund), Pérez-Guerra (Uvigo) and Loureiro-Porto (UIB), for the wealth and depth of their feedback.

I am now a postdoctoral at the University of Vigo.
