I'm delighted to share that I successfully defended my PhD dissertation this morning.

The thesis, titled [*Variation in the clausal complementation system in World Englishes: A corpus-based study of REGRET*](https://www.investigo.biblioteca.uvigo.es/xmlui/handle/11093/1688?show=full){target="_blank"}, was awarded the highest distinction (*sobresaliente cum laude*).

I am deeply grateful to my supervisors, **Prof. Elena Seoane** (University of Vigo) and **Prof. Manfred Krug** (University of Bamberg), for their guidance throughout this journey.

I would also like to sincerely thank the members of the examination board — **Prof. Sarah Buschfeld** (TU Dortmund), **Prof. Javier Pérez-Guerra** (University of Vigo), and **Prof. Lourdes Loureiro-Porto** (University of the Balearic Islands) — for their insightful and enriching feedback.

I’m now continuing my academic path as a **postdoctoral researcher at the University of Vigo**.
