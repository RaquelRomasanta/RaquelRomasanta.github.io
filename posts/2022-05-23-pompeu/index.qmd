Last week, I had the pleasure of giving an invited talk at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, titled *Towards Monolingualism: The Linguistic Ecology of Gibraltar*.

The discussion sparked engaging reflections among both staff and students, who drew thought-provoking parallels between the sociolinguistic dynamics of Gibraltar and those of Catalonia. There was particular interest in the potential creole status of Yanito, one of Gibraltar’s vernaculars.

I’m very grateful for the warm welcome and the stimulating feedback I received — it was a real pleasure to share ideas in such a vibrant academic setting.
