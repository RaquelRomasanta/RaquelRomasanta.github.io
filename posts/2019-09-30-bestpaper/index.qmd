I’m happy to share that I was awarded the **Best Paper Prize for a Junior Researcher** at the [*8th Biennial International Conference on the Linguistics of Contemporary English* (8 BICLCE)](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/eng-ling/biclce-2019/){target="_blank"} , held at Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg, Germany (26–28 September).

My paper, *Negation and the Cognitive Complexity Principle in the English Clausal Complementation System*, forms part of my PhD research, supervised by **Elena Seoane** and **Manfred Krug**.

I'm very grateful for this recognition and for the opportunity to present my work at such a stimulating and welcoming conference.
